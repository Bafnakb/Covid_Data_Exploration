# Covid Data Exploration

I am thrilled to showcase my Data Analytics project, which focuses on COVID Data Exploration using SQL. 
For this project, I am leveraging a MySQL server to conduct in-depth data exploration and analysis.

**Objective:**

The main objective of this project was to utilize SQL in SQL Server to conduct comprehensive exploration and analysis of COVID-19 data. 
The project aimed to uncover valuable insights into different dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic, including new and total cases, new and total deaths, new and total vaccinations, and percentages population death and vaccination.

**Data gathering & cleaning:**

The COVID-19 data was obtained by downloading a CSV file from the website "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths." 
Upon obtaining the dataset, it was imported into the SQL server and then partitioned into two distinct tables: Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations. 
The data cleaning process was conducted to guarantee data accuracy, resolve any discrepancies or mistakes, and prepare the dataset for subsequent analysis.

**Data Processing:**

The COVID-19 data underwent processing and analysis through the application of SQL queries. 
These queries conducted calculations, aggregations, and comparisons, enabling the extraction of valuable insights from the dataset. 
Temporary tables and views were employed to store intermediate results and simplify subsequent analysis tasks

**Questions asked:**

1.	Total Cases Vs Total Deaths: Examined the relationship between total COVID-19 cases and total deaths.
2.	Likelihood of dying if you contract COVID in your Country: Calculated the percentage likelihood of death if a person contracts COVID-19 in a specific country.
3.	Total Cases Vs Populations: Explored the percentage of the population affected by COVID-19 in different locations.
4.	Countries with the highest infection rate compared to the population: Identified countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
5.	Countries with the highest death count per population: Identified countries with the highest death count per population.
6.	Break things down by Continent: Analysed COVID-19 data by continent.
7.	Continents with the highest death count per population: Identified continents with the highest death count per population.
8.	Total death percentage: Calculated the total death percentage based on COVID-19 data.
9.	Total population Vs Vaccinations: Explored the relationship between the total population and the number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered.

**Key Highlights:**

• Imported the COVID-19 data into the SQL server, segregating it into distinct tables for deaths and vaccinations.
• Utilized SQL queries to conduct thorough exploration and analysis of the data, addressing various questions, such as comparing total cases to total deaths, determining the likelihood of COVID-19 mortality in different countries, examining total cases in relation to population, calculating the percentage of the population affected by COVID-19, identifying countries with the highest infection rates and death counts, performing a breakdown by continent, and analysing global statistics.
• Created temporary tables and views to efficiently store and retrieve data for visualization and in-depth analysis. 
• Successfully tackled challenges and errors encountered during the project, showcasing strong problem-solving skills and a genuine eagerness to learn.

**Conclusion:**

By leveraging SQL in the SQL server, this project accomplished its goal of exploring and analysing COVID-19 data effectively. 
The process involved data collection, cleaning, and SQL query-based data processing, leading to the identification of crucial insights regarding COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population percentages. 
The project emphasized the importance of data exploration and showcased the efficacy of SQL in extracting valuable information from extensive datasets.
